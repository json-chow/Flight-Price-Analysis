# Flight-Price-Analysis
Analyzed flight speed and fare patterns using statistical tests and time series modeling (MLR, AR, EWMA) to uncover insights across airlines, aircraft, and routes

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Flight Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dilwong/flightprices/data) from Kaggle.

A subset of the dataset was used for this project.

## Project Description
In Part A, we analyzed the average flight speed differences across airlines, aircrafts, and routes. We preprocessed the data and examined the distribution of the speeds, performing statistical tests to determine if there was a significant difference in speeds between the airlines, aircrafts, and routes.

In Part B, we constructed linear regression models to investigate the relationship between fares and other features such as distance, flight duration, and seat occupancy. Outlier detection and feature selection were performed to identify the most important features for predicting fares.

In Part C, we used time series modeling techniques such as autoregressive (AR) and exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) to analyze the daily and weekly patterns in flight prices.
